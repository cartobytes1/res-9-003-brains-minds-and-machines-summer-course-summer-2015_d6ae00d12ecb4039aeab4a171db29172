Tutorial Overview
-----------------

| ![Diagram of human brain with two arrows emerging from the rear (occipital lobe). The ventral stream goes to the side, along the temporal lobe, and the dorsal stream goes toward the top of the brain.](/coursemedia/res-9-003-brains-minds-and-machines-summer-course-summer-2015/7d776beca5cd978cd8d5d36f13eb9597_tutor1.jpg) | The _two-streams hypothesis_ distinguishes two processing pathways in the brain: The ventral stream (also known as the "what pathway") shown in purple and the dorsal stream (also known as the "where" pathway") shown in green.

This tutorial first introduces basic neuroscience concepts, including the structure of neurons and how they communicate information, brain anatomy and the dorsal / ventral visual pathways, and methods for probing the behavior of neural circuits. It then explores the nature of processing along the ventral pathway that is involved in visual recognition.

Basic neuroscience concepts and methods are introduced in several courses published on [MIT OpenCourseWare](./resolveuid/05fcbd61fbc5de632b9274d820e4fd60), including [_9.00SC Introduction to Psychology_](/courses/9-00sc-introduction-to-psychology-fall-2011/) taught by John Gabrieli, [_9.01 Introduction to Neuroscience_](/courses/9-01-introduction-to-neuroscience-fall-2007/) taught by Mark Bear and Sebastian Seung, [_9.04 Sensory Systems_](/courses/9-04-sensory-systems-fall-2013/) taught by Peter Schiller and Christian Brown, and [_9.10 Cognitive Neuroscience_](/courses/9-10-cognitive-neuroscience-spring-2006/) taught by Suzanne Corkin.

An online search for any of the topics covered in this tutorial will yield many pointers to useful background material. The Society for Neuroscience hosts an [Education Resources in Neuroscience](https://www.sfn.org/Initiatives/Public-Education-Programs) portal that contains extensive online resources for teaching and learning neuroscience.
