Tutorial Overview
-----------------

| ![An array of handwritten digits accompanied by a 3-D scatter plot.](/coursemedia/res-9-003-brains-minds-and-machines-summer-course-summer-2015/ccf77ab85d5593babc2e33ad552f3a74_tutor3.jpg) | Visualization of the results of _principal components analysis_ applied to high-dimensional data capturing visual properties of handwritten digits. The data was reduced to three dimensions that capture most of the variation in the original data, roughly segregating the data into the corresponding digits, as portrayed by the different colors of the data points.

A key aspect of intelligent systems is their ability to learn from data or past experience. Modern methods for data analysis also draw heavily on techniques for learning patterns in data. This tutorial introduces many common methods for _machine learning_ that are used in the fields of intelligence science and data science. The video lectures explore some of the basic concepts and theory underlying the behavior of various learning methods and their application to different kinds of problems. This theory is complemented by hands-on computer labs in the MATLAB速 computing environment, to explore the behavior of machine learning methods in practice.

### Machine Learning Lab Exercises

This [website for the Machine Learning Day](https://cbmm.mit.edu/machine-learning-day) was prepared by Lorenzo Rosasco and Georgios Evangelopoulos for the 2016 Brains, Minds, and Machines summer course. It contains descriptions of lab activities related to the machine learning methods presented in the above tutorial videos, with supporting MATLAB code and data files that can be downloaded from the website.
